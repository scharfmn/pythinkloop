Title: Hello and what

Starting this blog to document my Python and programming study & working-through etc. I studied cognitive science, linguistics, and literature in school, along with a little bit of computer science. Literature won out in one sense (Ph.D.), but in terms of a day-to-day professional life, Python programming (mostly backend) has been it. 

Realizing the blog's name shouts out to [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) (which I really appreciate as a free resource that reflects care and the author's considered point of view) and to [Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/) (which I hope to attend someday). That wasn't intentional, but it does point to reach.

I also hear "pink" and "koop!" (Dutch for "Tickets!") in it...

Speaking of influences, in terms of books, David Beazley's [The Python Essential Reference](https://www.dabeaz.com/per.html) is the one that really captures the heart of the language for me, but it was written when Python2 was still the standard. While a 5th edition was once planned, it will not be completed. A different book is apprently in the works, and while the wait continues, it may be the time to finally checkout the [Python Cookbook](https://www.dabeaz.com/cookbook.html) (now however almost 8 years old).

In terms of working through and refreshing what I thought I knew (and often didn't) recently, it's Brett Slatkin's [Effective Python](https://effectivepython.com/). I just got the second edition, and will be working through that. It's not clear to me how I can post of what I do re: that. I guess we'll see.

The other big thing for me (as for so many others) remains [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python). I'll do a post sometime of people whose answers I've read repeatedly.

So I'll be writing about things for my own understanding: small concepts and patterns, algorithm implementations, etc. I also imagine there will be bits of other languages. I hope some of it is useful. Anyway let's see - looking forward.
