</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Starting this blog to document my Python and programming study &amp; working-through etc. I studied cognitive science, linguistics, and literature in school, along with a little bit of computer science. Literature won out in one sense(Ph.D.), but in terms of a day-to-day professional life, Python programming (mostly backend) has been it. </p>
<p>Realizing the name shouts out to <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Think Python</a> (which helped me) and to <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a> (which I hope to attend someday). It wasn't intentional, but it does point to reach.</p>
<p>(I also hear "pink" and "koop!" - Dutch for "Tickets!" - in it...)</p>
<p>In terms of books, David Beazley's <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/per.html">The Python Essential Reference</a> is the one that really turned things for me, but it was written when Python2 was still the standard. While a 5th edition was once planned, it will not be completed (<a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/per.html">see note</a>). A different book is apprently in the works, and while the wait continues, it may be the time to finally checkout the <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/cookbook.html">Python Cookbook</a> (now almost 8 years old).</p>
<p>In terms of working through and refreshing what I thought I knew (and often didn't) these days, it's Brett Slatkin's <a href="https://effectivepython.com/">Effective Python</a>. I just got the second edition, and will be working through that. It's not clear to me how much of that I can post here. I guess we'll see.</p>
<p>The other big thing for me (as for so many others) has been <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python">Stack Overflow</a>. I'll do a post sometime of people whose answers I've read repeatedly.</p>
<p>So I'll be writing about things for my own understanding: small concepts and patterns, algorithm implementations, etc. I also imagine there will be bits of other languages. I hope some of it is useful. Anyway let's see - looking forward.</p>
